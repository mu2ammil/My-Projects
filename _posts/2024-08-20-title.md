Write a Python / R Program to find Armstrong number. 

You are supposed to create a Program to find 3 digit Armstrong number. 

Make a program which accepts a 3 digit number from user and check & confirms whether it is an Armstrong number or not. Proper message should be displayed as the result.

Interface should be attractive and Numbers should be between 100 - 999.



Note:
Armstrong number of 3 digits, the sum of cubes of each digit is equal to the number itself. 
For example:

153 = 1*1*1 + 5*5*5 + 3*3*3  
       =  1 + 125 + 27
       =  153

Hence 153 is an Armstrong number.
